# üìù Project Description
In the realm of software development and agile methodologies, our project embarks on the journey to create a fully functional Real Estate Web Application. 
This collaborative educational endeavor aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of software development while laying the foundation for future endeavors in the field.
The following core features should be included in the project:

* Client
	* Search for a Property: Homebuyers can efficiently search for properties using specific criteria such as location, price range, bedroom count, and amenities.
	* Save Favorites: Users can curate a list of their favorite properties for easy access and comparison.
	* Request Property Visits: Interested homebuyers can seamlessly schedule property viewing appointments through the system.
	* Broker Discovery: The application facilitates the search for real estate brokers to assist in the buying process.
	* Mortgage Calculator: A mortgage calculator feature aids homebuyers in estimating monthly payments based on loan amount and interest rate.
	* This feature is not applicable for the properties posted to rent.
* Broker
	* Submit Offers: Brokers have the ability to submit purchase offers on behalf of their clients and monitor the status of these offers.
	* Request Property Visits: Brokers can schedule property visits on behalf of their clients.
	* Property Listing Management: CRUD operations on property listings allow brokers to maintain their property inventory.
	* Matching Properties: Brokers can utilize the system to match available properties with potential buyers based on their preferences and requirements.
	* Offer Management: Brokers can review and manage offers submitted by homebuyers for the properties they represent.
	* Visit Management: Brokers have the capability to manage property visit appointments, including rescheduling and cancellations.

* System Administrator:
	* CRUD Operations on Brokers: System administrators maintain control by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on broker profiles.


	As we navigate this project, our primary focus is on the collaborative development of a fully operational real estate web application. 
	Each user type's features serve to enrich the user experience and provide practical insights into agile methodologies, teamwork, and project management.

# Project Approach and Technology üéØ
	
	In our project, we're taking a step-by-step approach to make sure our web application meets the provided requirements. 
	First, we carefully analyzed the customers‚Äô needs to decide on the webpages we have to create. For this project, the following technologies will be used:
	
- MySQL will be used for creating the database structure and writing the necessary SQL queries. 
		Microsoft SQL has a more professional and reliable syntax. However, MySQL is simpler and more suitable for our project. 
		Although other technologies like MariaDB have better performance and more features, MySQL is much more popular and has much better support.
		
- HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap will be used for the static front-end elements.
		JavaScript and React will be used for the dynamic front-end elements.
		The reason for choosing React instead of AngularJS is because we are more familiar with React and because React is a faster framework.
		React is also known for its scalability; it is more scalable than other frameworks like Vue.js.
		
- PHP will be used to communicate with the server.
		Other languages like Java are generally better as they support more features and provide access to a wide range of libraries.
		In addition, languages like Node.js have simpler syntax and offer better support.
		However, PHP will primarily be used for posting and extracting data from the database, 
		as one of the team members already has a lot of experience with database communication using PHP.
		
	The above list of technologies covers all our needs to build the required web application.
